# Mike Burr's Home Page Page

I cannot express how tired I am of dealing with "my home page". One thing is for sure, my home page has never been for _*me*_...!

Until now...

No. No, no ...actually, possibly not even now. I urgently need a presentable not-embarrasing webisite of some kind to suit _me_ and, unfortunately, all the money-making rigmarole.

So that's how this starts. Here is an empty promise I'll make to myself: I'll at least keep the "content" that goes on unintuitive.org here... whatever form it takes.

And why do I even care. I've had 1000 home pages. It is so _played_ for me. I wanna do other stuff.

So, look forward to clear, orderly content. Bore-ing.
