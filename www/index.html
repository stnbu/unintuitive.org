      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
	Hello. My name is <a href="mailto:mb@unintuitive.org">Mike Burr</a>. I live in Santa Fe, New Mexico. I've been a "technology"
	(computers) related engineer for my whole professional life. <a href="mailto:mb@unintuitive.org">Drop me a line</a> if you would like any other information at about me or my work. I don't even mind texts if you are human: <code>area code six six nine 800 7593</code>
      </p>
      <p>I've drifted from thing to thing over the years, but I'm most interested in collaborating
	or even being paid for involvement in</p>
      <ul>
	<li>Blockchain, primarily Ethereum, and pretty much anything else in that universe.</li>
	<li>Programming. Lately it's been with Rust.</li>
	<li>Gentech. I have almost zero formal "wet science" education, but I do have a pop-sci
	  level of knowledge and some recent level of involvement.</li>
	<li>Git* powerusing</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Portfolio</h2>
      <p>
	Here is some portfolio-like information (in no particular order) that you may be interested in if judging my suitability for employment
	(or even just regular judging).
      </p>
      <ul>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/stnbu/abandoned-addresses">Abandoned Addresses</a>, an elaborate
	  exercise in web3 (Ethereum) stuff, that may or may not be directly useful. A <a href="https://dapps.unintuitive.org/abandoned-addresses/">live demo</a>
  	  is available. You need to have Metamask (or similar), and be on the Rinkeby test network. To use all
	  functionality you will need a small amount of (Rinkeby test) Ether, which
	  <a href="mailto:mb@unintuitive.org">I</a> am happy to send upon request. You can also use
	  <a href="https://faucet.rinkeby.io/">a faucet</a>. Note that this project includes "web3"
	  code written in, among others: Rust, JavaScript, Golang, and Python.
	<li>Various Rust learning and experimentation (Please note that I am still learning Rust, just like you.
	  Yes I have read <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/">the book</a>!)
	  <ul>
	    <li>Added <a href="https://github.com/eugene-bulkin/rust-bk-tree/pull/12/files">serialization support</a>
	      to <a href="https://github.com/eugene-bulkin/rust-bk-tree">rust-bk-tree</a>.</li>
	    <li><a href="https://github.com/stnbu/sandbox/tree/master/wasm/web3minimal"> Web3 meets Rust Wasm</a> --
	      I have been working for weeks on trying to get Rust "web3" code (that is, Ethereum dapp code) to
	      successfully compile to wasm usable by a web browser. The idea is to replace things like
	      <code>web3.js</code> and <code>ethers.js</code> with code written in Rust that compiles into wasm
	      and is usable <em>in their stead</em>. It turns out to be a hard problem! This particular Rust package
	      is very simple (although it took months of study): A minimal Rust wasm project that includes
	      <code>rust-web3</code>. So, importantly, it doesn't DO anything. But is a good starting point
	      for a Rust wasm+web3 project.</li>
	    <li><a href="https://github.com/stnbu/sandbox/tree/master/rust/spelib">spelib</a> -- a very simple
	      spellchecking library that uses the above BKTree serialization to store the nearest-neighbor tree
	      word tree generated from a word file. Processing the word file and creating the tree takes 1+ minute.
	      deserializing the result on subsequent startup is sub-seconds in scale.</li>
	    <li><a href="https://github.com/stnbu/sandbox/tree/master/rust/burger-chef">Burger Chef</a> -- a
	      playground I created to experiment with the BKTree serialization problem. What is interesting in
	      this package is that the short file you see in <code>src/main.rs</code> is after weeks of
	      experimenting with serialization strategies (which is in the repo history) until I realized Rust
	      has it handled! What a ride.</li>
	    <li>A <a href="https://dapps.unintuitive.org/sandbox/wasm/julia/">Julia set explorer</a> -- I did
	      not write this! But, it's amazing and I can explain the code to anyone who will listen. I read the
	      whole <a href="https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/book/">wasm book</a> (and more), and this simple thing really stood out for me. Wasm lets you get amazing
	      performance out of client-side browser code.</li>
